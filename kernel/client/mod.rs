//! ZeroFS protocol client.
//!
//! One TCP or AF_UNIX connection carries every request for a mount, tagged so
//! they can complete out of order. Callers transmit directly and wait on their
//! own tags; one connection task blocks on the stream, routes complete replies,
//! and wakes the matching callers.
//!
//! # Reconnection
//!
//! Fids are connection-scoped. After a transport failure the connection task
//! reconnects with backoff and restores recorded state before releasing blocked
//! requests. A failure turns everything in flight into a resend; only a replay
//! that cannot rebuild observed state, or a protocol desync, ends the logical
//! session.
//!
//! Reorder-sensitive mutations keep one operation ID across resends. Resends
//! stop at the protocol retry horizon; expiry returns a disconnect error with
//! an ambiguous outcome. The negotiated message size is fixed for the logical
//! session, so a reconnect candidate must negotiate the same value and an
//! ambiguous mutation is resendable byte for byte.
//!
//! An opened fid that no longer exists becomes an `ESTALE` tombstone; its
//! operations fail without affecting other fids. Byte-range locks are held by
//! the server against the connection, so every granted lock is recorded and
//! has to be reacquired alongside its fid.
//!
//! # Layout
//!
//! [`session`] holds connection state, [`slots`] the tag table, [`retry`] request
//! transmission, [`receive`] socket reads and reply routing, and [`reply`] each
//! caller's tag wait. [`flush`] cancels interrupted requests; [`signals`] owns
//! the task signal masks used while sending and cancelling.
//!
//! [`registry`] records fid and lock replay state and interns credentials,
//! [`durability`] tracks the obligations an `fsync` has to cover, [`retry`]
//! bounds one operation's attempts, and [`reconnect`] probes targets and
//! replays recorded state onto a replacement connection.
//!
//! [`ops`] holds the request methods, [`endpoint`] parses the mount source, and
//! [`errors`] maps status codes.
