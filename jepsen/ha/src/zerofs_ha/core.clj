  "Jepsen HA test for ZeroFS: local MinIO + a ZeroFS leader/standby pair over it +
  a multi-target FUSE or native-kernel mount. Nemesis kills
  leader/standby/both/MinIO then heals.
  Workload is a grow-only set (add = create+fsync a uniquely-named file, fsync
  being a global durability barrier; read = ls); set-full checker asserts no
  acked add is lost. All-local: one logical node, dummy SSH, process management
  via start-stop-daemon + shell rather than jepsen.control. A separate
  --fsync-honesty scenario checks that a successful fsync never reports success for
  an un-fsync'd write lost to a both-nodes cold restart."

(defn statfs-checker
  "The growth in statfs-reported used inodes (a baseline read on the empty fs vs the
  final read, after temp cleanup) must equal the growth in the tree's actual inode
  census: every created file/dir is one inode, adds increment and removes decrement,
  so the two move together. A takeover that regressed the usage stats / inode-id
  allocator, or mishandled a delete's decrement, breaks the equality even when `ls`
  (the set checker) still passes.

  The census (not the integer-set size) is the reference on purpose: a fault can leave
  an interrupted-rename `.tmp-` behind, which is a real inode statfs correctly counts
  but `read-set` (integer names only) skips. Counting against the set size would then
  false-fail on a perfectly consistent fs; counting against the census does not, while
  still catching a genuine stats/allocator drift (used-inodes != census)."
